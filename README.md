# tic-tac-toe-KiKTask1
This tic-tac-toe game comprises of two versions:
1. The regular version with randomly generated computer moves
2. The one that uses recursion to determine the next best move

The second version, in turn has two versions:
1. A complete version that works by occupying the losing square, which is identified with recursion
2. A version that assigns weights to each move and thus computes the best move(incomplete)
